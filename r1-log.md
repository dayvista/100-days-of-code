The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Friday, January 3rd, 2020].

## Log

### For days prior to my 13th day, please visit my Twitter profile @ twitter.com/dayvista_dev.
### I chose to fork this repo in order to add another layer of accountability to my pursuit of completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

### Day 13: January 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked all the way through the Applied Visual Design module (Responsive Web Design) on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: I love working with HTML and CSS. I look forward to applying these lessons to my own personal webpage creations. I'm also looking forward to the responsive web design projects. Maybe I'll love it less when I get deep into creating my own pages. Lol.

### Day 14: January 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made it through Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, and CSS Flexbox in the Responsive Web Design portion of FCC. Made it about halfway through CSS Grid.

**Thoughts**: I'm interested to work with Flexbox and Grid, and to learn the use cases for each one. Studying for hours every day can be grueling, but I will master this material eventually. It's all about the incremental progress (10,000 hours). Cry in the dojo, sweat on the battlefield (or something like that). Should start the design projects for this certification tomorrow or the next day.

### Day 15: January 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the CSS Grid module on FCC and moved onto the projects. I began the Tribute Page project and worked on it for ~1 hr.

**Thoughts**: I've heard that starting anything new is like getting a rocket-ship into space. At first, it requires immense amounts of energy and redirection, and then it becomes smooth sailing once you break into orbit (read: break through your crusty old habits). It took me about an hour just to figure out how to get responsive images onto my website. Nonetheless, once I get into that flow state, this stuff actually becomes fun.

### Day 16: January 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Tribute Page project. Formatted the images and text. Added cards behind content of page.

**Thoughts**: I need to figure out how to push the footer card below the content card. I'm nearly finished! This is fun.

### Day 17: January 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Tribute Page project! I perfected the cards, hyperlinked an image, and added a button. Made the site totally responsive (mobile-first, even).

**Thoughts**: All that hard worked paid off. Onto the next project! :D

### Day 18: January 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got to work on the FCC Survey Page project. Made the barebones template for what will soon become a thing of glory.

**Thoughts**: Starting a new project is always the hardest part. Once it starts to pan out, and the problems that I actually have to solve become transparent, I enjoy the process much more. However, it is not about enjoyment beyond my intrinsic fascination with the act of coding itself. It is about sitting down and doing the work, regardless of how I feel on any given day.

### Day 19: January 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Survey project. I became familiar with the actual structure of an HTML/CSS survey webpage. I'll likely finish within 2 days if I follow the trajectory I set out for myself.

**Thoughts**: Half of coding feels like figuring out what problems I'm actually trying to solve. I'm looking forward to becoming more fluent with the architecture of HTML and CSS documents.

### Day 20: January 22nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent an hour figuring out how to align form elements along a vertical columnar axis. -.-' I continued onto the list elements of the HTML page.

**Thoughts**: After telling my girlfriend that I spent an hour trying to figure out how to do one simple thing, she told me, "you learned patience and perseverance!" Amen to that. I was very tired from working my 9 to 5 today, and feeling generally burned out. Once I started coding, I felt much better. Just knowing that there are career opportunities out there for this line of work fuels my drive significantly.

### Day 21: January 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Survey Page project on FCC. I moved onto the Product Landing Page project. I started creating the template for the website in HTML and CSS. A responsive nav bar was created.

**Thoughts**: I feel much more productive with a mechanical full-size keyboard and a second monitor. Having a day off of work also helps. Gotta use the free time when it comes. I love this learning process because it's helping me to structure the rest of my life. I'm having to let go of bad habits one by one because I need my brain as un-cluttered as possible. It feels great using the computer and internet for productivity, when they've sucked up so much of my free time in the past.

### Day 22: January 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked for an hour or two on the Product Landing Page project on freeCodeCamp. I figured out how to compress videos to be web-friendly, then add them to an HTML document. I made a little more progress on the nav bar, this time moving it to the left side of the page and working on formatting the text and logo a smidge.

**Thoughts**: I really need to pace myself and be generally patient with my efforts, especially on days that I work my regular job. It's okay if I only code for an hour. The intention to succeed and the drive to continuously learn are there. No need to worry. Worry implies the possibility of failure. Oh, also, naps are VITAL.
