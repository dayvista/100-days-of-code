## Log

### For days prior to my 13th day, please visit my Twitter profile @ twitter.com/dayvista_dev.
### I chose to fork this repo in order to add another layer of accountability to my pursuit of completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

### Day 13: January 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked all the way through the Applied Visual Design module (Responsive Web Design) on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: I love working with HTML and CSS. I look forward to applying these lessons to my own personal webpage creations. I'm also looking forward to the responsive web design projects. Maybe I'll love it less when I get deep into creating my own pages. Lol.

### Day 14: January 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made it through Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, and CSS Flexbox in the Responsive Web Design portion of FCC. Made it about halfway through CSS Grid.

**Thoughts**: I'm interested to work with Flexbox and Grid, and to learn the use cases for each one. Studying for hours every day can be grueling, but I will master this material eventually. It's all about the incremental progress (10,000 hours). Cry in the dojo, sweat on the battlefield (or something like that). Should start the design projects for this certification tomorrow or the next day.

### Day 15: January 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the CSS Grid module on FCC and moved onto the projects. I began the Tribute Page project and worked on it for ~1 hr.

**Thoughts**: I've heard that starting anything new is like getting a rocket-ship into space. At first, it requires immense amounts of energy and redirection, and then it becomes smooth sailing once you break into orbit (read: break through your crusty old habits). It took me about an hour just to figure out how to get responsive images onto my website. Nonetheless, once I get into that flow state, this stuff actually becomes fun.

### Day 16: January 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Tribute Page project. Formatted the images and text. Added cards behind content of page.

**Thoughts**: I need to figure out how to push the footer card below the content card. I'm nearly finished! This is fun.
