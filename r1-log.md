# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - William Davis - liam@dayvista.work

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Friday, January 3rd, 2020].

## Log

### For days prior to my 13th day, please visit my Twitter profile @ twitter.com/dayvista_dev.
### I chose to fork this repo in order to add another layer of accountability to my pursuit of completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

### Day 13: January 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked all the way through the Applied Visual Design module (Responsive Web Design) on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: I love working with HTML and CSS. I look forward to applying these lessons to my own personal webpage creations. I'm also looking forward to the responsive web design projects. Maybe I'll love it less when I get deep into creating my own pages. Lol.

### Day 14: January 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made it through Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, and CSS Flexbox in the Responsive Web Design portion of FCC. Made it about halfway through CSS Grid.

**Thoughts**: I'm interested to work with Flexbox and Grid, and to learn the use cases for each one. Studying for hours every day can be grueling, but I will master this material eventually. It's all about the incremental progress (10,000 hours). Cry in the dojo, sweat on the battlefield (or something like that). Should start the design projects for this certification tomorrow or the next day.

### Day 15: January 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the CSS Grid module on FCC and moved onto the projects. I began the Tribute Page project and worked on it for ~1 hr.

**Thoughts**: I've heard that starting anything new is like getting a rocket-ship into space. At first, it requires immense amounts of energy and redirection, and then it becomes smooth sailing once you break into orbit (read: break through your crusty old habits). It took me about an hour just to figure out how to get responsive images onto my website. Nonetheless, once I get into that flow state, this stuff actually becomes fun.

### Day 16: January 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Tribute Page project. Formatted the images and text. Added cards behind content of page.

**Thoughts**: I need to figure out how to push the footer card below the content card. I'm nearly finished! This is fun.

### Day 17: January 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Tribute Page project! I perfected the cards, hyperlinked an image, and added a button. Made the site totally responsive (mobile-first, even).

**Thoughts**: All that hard worked paid off. Onto the next project! :D

### Day 18: January 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got to work on the FCC Survey Page project. Made the barebones template for what will soon become a thing of glory.

**Thoughts**: Starting a new project is always the hardest part. Once it starts to pan out, and the problems that I actually have to solve become transparent, I enjoy the process much more. However, it is not about enjoyment beyond my intrinsic fascination with the act of coding itself. It is about sitting down and doing the work, regardless of how I feel on any given day.

### Day 19: January 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Survey project. I became familiar with the actual structure of an HTML/CSS survey webpage. I'll likely finish within 2 days if I follow the trajectory I set out for myself.

**Thoughts**: Half of coding feels like figuring out what problems I'm actually trying to solve. I'm looking forward to becoming more fluent with the architecture of HTML and CSS documents.

### Day 20: January 22nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent an hour figuring out how to align form elements along a vertical columnar axis. -.-' I continued onto the list elements of the HTML page.

**Thoughts**: After telling my girlfriend that I spent an hour trying to figure out how to do one simple thing, she told me, "you learned patience and perseverance!" Amen to that. I was very tired from working my 9 to 5 today, and feeling generally burned out. Once I started coding, I felt much better. Just knowing that there are career opportunities out there for this line of work fuels my drive significantly.

### Day 21: January 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Survey Page project on FCC. I moved onto the Product Landing Page project. I started creating the template for the website in HTML and CSS. A responsive nav bar was created.

**Thoughts**: I feel much more productive with a mechanical full-size keyboard and a second monitor. Having a day off of work also helps. Gotta use the free time when it comes. I love this learning process because it's helping me to structure the rest of my life. I'm having to let go of bad habits one by one because I need my brain as un-cluttered as possible. It feels great using the computer and internet for productivity, when they've sucked up so much of my free time in the past.

### Day 22: January 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked for an hour or two on the Product Landing Page project on freeCodeCamp. I figured out how to compress videos to be web-friendly, then add them to an HTML document. I made a little more progress on the nav bar, this time moving it to the left side of the page and working on formatting the text and logo a smidge.

**Thoughts**: I really need to pace myself and be generally patient with my efforts, especially on days that I work my regular job. It's okay if I only code for an hour. The intention to succeed and the drive to continuously learn are there. No need to worry. Worry implies the possibility of failure. Oh, also, naps are VITAL.

### Day 23: January 25th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent a couple hours making a number of small adjustments to the layout of the Brave the Day Boutique website. The color scheme was changed. I spent most of the day adjusting the responsiveness of the website. Much was learned about creating responsive websites in pure HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts**: I'm starting to get the hang of responsive design, as well as how to work with divs like nav bars and containers. Coding can be so difficult, and then something suddenly clicks into place after hours of going back and forth on minutia. It's basically learning incarnate.

### Day 24: January 26th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent yet another couple hours finally figuring out exactly how to make a responsive side-nav-bar. I made some other minor adjustments to the formatting of the website.

**Thoughts**: That was grueling. I'm excited to get past the cryptic and gratuitous additions, though. Now I can finally start adding content!

### Day 25: January 27th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: The Product Landing Page project is complete! I also made a number of significant aesthetic modifications. The responsiveness of the page was also adjusted.

**Thoughts**: When I first started the Responsive Web Design certification, I was grateful to be working with a spatial language such as CSS. Now I can't wait to learn Javascript and work in a more logic-based ecosystem. CSS feels like Jenga sometimes. -.-*

### Day 26: January 28th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I ported all of my previous projects over to CodePen. Now I can edit the ones that involve real-world applications, and preserve the functionality of the original pages that were made for FCC projects. I managed to complete all of the requirements for the 4th Responsive Web Design project, the Technical Documentation Page, and turn it in. I still need to complete it aesthetically and add content besides base functionality.

**Thoughts**: Looking forwards: Once I complete the Responsive Web Design certification process, I'm going to start offering my services on various freelancing portals in order to gain more real-world experience and generally expand my portfolio. But first, I need a portfolio/resume webpage!

### Day 27: January 29th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I made aesthetic adjustments to the Tech. Doc. project. Content was added to the body. I tried to figure out how to make a sticky nav-bar based solely off of CSS/HTML. It would work with a top-nav (I think), but it was too much work. Once I know Javascript, I'll be able to do it.

**Thoughts**: I can get so wrapped up in non-essential problems. Part of learning how to code will be honing my discernment between necessary and frivolous bugs.

### Day 28: January 30th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Portfolio Webpage project, and thus earned the Responsive Web Design Certificate on FCC! I made considerable progress on the simple/minimalist design of my portfolio website. I figured out how to easily make a sticky nav (finally). The formatting and template of my portfolio website were created. I made a background animation in the welcome section that depicts curly-bracket birds flying into the horizon. :D

**Thoughts**: I feel like I'm making great progress. I'm starting to really enjoy this. I have a huge lesson plan for tackling Javascript after I finish the basics of my portfolio website.

### Day 29: January 31st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked for around an hour on formatting the welcome landing screen of my portfolio website. Most of what I did was scrapped in the end, but I still learned a lot (mostly about how difficult it is to center elements in CSS).

**Thoughts**: Portfolio website => Bootstrap Course + YouTube Videos => Javascript Course === PROFIT

### Day 30: February 1st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched Traversy Media's Udemy course on Vanilla Javascript. Worked on Basic Javascript problems on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It feels good to be diving into learning specifics about coding after working on projects for so long. I was beginning to feel really limited by pure HTML and CSS.

### Day 31: February 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued cranking away on Javascript challenges and lessons on both freeCodeCamp and Udemy (Traversy Media's Modern Javascript course).

**Thoughts**: I didn't have much time to code today and that was a bummer. -.- I really love getting into that flow state where I can spend a couple hours focusing on a specific problem or problem set. On the upside, I really look forward to experimenting with my new RPi 4B!

### Day 32: February 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I watched some more of Brad Traversy's Modern JS Udemy course and spent a couple hours on the Basic Javascript section of FCC.

**Thoughts**: Even though I never finished CS50, I'm thankful that I took it. I would recommend to any beginning programmer that he learn the basics of computer science before delving into a desired aspect of programming (web development, etc.). Knowing about things like for loops and more has helped me get a grasp of basic Javascript, and I imagine I'll be able to grasp other languages more easily as well (than if I had just started my web development journey from scratch).

### Day 33: February 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued learning Javascript on FCC and Udemy, this time moving onto ES6 from Basic Javascript.

**Thoughts**: Keep on keeping on!

### Day 34: February 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through the ES6 portion of Javascript challenges. I dreamt up another app idea to execute once I have a grasp of a full stack.

**Thoughts**: Although my work hours have been cut back for the next two weeks, and that's moderately financially frustrating, I'm stoked to have many hours a day to devote to study and rejuvenation.

### Day 35: February 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Kept working through the JS challenges on FCC. This time, I worked on Debugging and Data Structures.

**Thoughts**: I actually have an affinity for DS. Hopefully the same is true for algorithms.

### Day 36: February 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I got wrecked by Basic Algorithm Scripting on FCC. I made some progress through the challenges, but it was very slow.

**Thoughts**: The same is not true for algorithms. I can tell that, for both data structures and algorithms, learning them thoroughly is going to be a matter of repition.

### Day 37: February 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through some more algorithms on FCC. I began a DOM project on Traversy Media' Udemy course.

**Thoughts**: I don't need to worry about having to Google answers to algorithm/data structure problems at this point in my learning journey. I'm supposed to piece together information from many sources into a cohesive whole, not reinvent the wheel. The best thing that I can do is break each problem into multiple sub-problems, find the answers to those problems on Google or SO, and write my own composite solution to the proto-problem without having to look up the solution.

### Day 38: February 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I made it through the algorithm section on FCC. I began working on the Task List DOM practice project on Traversy Media's Udemy course.

**Thoughts**: I'm so glad to be working on projects again. Just applying what I've learned to a project, even when I'm basically just coding along, enables me to see the relevance of the information I'm ingesting. Stoked about taking Traversy's 20 JS Projects Course next. Slow and steady wins the race.

### Day 39: February 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the OOP Javascript section of challenges on FCC. Completed the loan calculator project for the Modern Javascript course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: I've realized that I'm not stuck in tutorial hell, I'm just ingraining the fundamentals of programming in order to build my own projects. Once I do begin building my own projects, in a month or so, I'll be able to use these (essentially cut-and-paste) projects as reference for the minutia of my work.

### Day 40: February 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed another practice project for the Modern Javascript course on Udemy. This time, it was the number guesser game. I finally made it through the grueling Functional Programming section of challenges on FCC. I learned about filter, map, reduce, etc.

**Thoughts**: Working through problems all day can be so grueling. It's reassuring to remember to stay the course, and that I'll be able to create my own stuff soon.

### Day 41: February 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent an hour working through 3 algorithm problems on FCC. I had just worked an 8-hour shift, so it was slow going. Almost to the projects, though. 0,0

**Thoughts**: This is actually painful. My brain physically hurts. I'm done with thoughts.

1. [Javascript Data Structures & Algorithms on FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)


### Day 42: February 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on algorithm problems on FCC for an hour.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling exhausted today, and it is yet another cloudy day outside. The juxtaposition between working jobs I hate and forcing myself to study something I love is really wearing on me.

1. [Javascript Data Structures & Algorithms on FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)


### Day 43: February 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on more FCC JS algorithms.

**Thoughts**: The sun is out and it's my birthday! I'm feeling particularly inspired. I have renewed inspiration to continue with my studying until I complete these courses, build some side projects of my own, and land a job. Peace!

1. [Javascript Data Structures & Algorithms on FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)


### Day 44: February 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I kept working on Javascript algorithms. Only a couple challenges left until the final project section!

**Thoughts**: Putting this much time into algorithms and data structures will definitely pay off in the future. I'm even starting to enjoy practicing them.

1. [Javascript Data Structures & Algorithms on FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)


### Day 45: February 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I nearly made it through all of the Javascript algorithm project problems over the course of 6 or so hours. I mainly practiced recursion, regex, and specific methods that my brain is too fried to remember.

**Thoughts**: I find it kind of bothersome that memorizing the intricacies of algorithms, data structures, and Javascript in general is redundant except when interviewing for a job. In real life, I just look this stuff up when I need to know it. Regardless, if it gets me a job, that must mean that it's not pointless!

### Day 46: February 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I tried my hand at the last Javascript project on freeCodeCamp, which involves calculating the amount of change to return to a customer (if any at all). It is the most difficult problem yet.

**Thoughts**: I'm so close. This has been a gauntlet. Nay... a crucible!

### Day 47: February 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Javascript Algorithms & Data Structures certificate requirements on freeCodeCamp! I also worked on the Vanilla Javascript Udemy course and tried my hand at a little Bootstrap.

**Thoughts**: I'm so happy to be moving onto more functional and project-based learning.

### Day 48: February 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent some more time working on the Book List OOP project for Traversy Media's Javascript course. I finished it by adding local storage and UI refinement to the app.

**Thoughts**: It's good to be building a base of tutorials that I can reference once I face similar obstacles in projects of my own. I'm looking forward to attending Hack Connecticut tomorrow night.

### Day 49: February 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I learned about AJAX, Async, and REST APIs by coding my own basic HTTP requests in JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: Working with APIs is a blast!

### Day 50: February 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I built a custom HTTP library, learning about the different ways to make requests/callbacks/promises using async/await and ES5/ES6/ES7 syntaxes.

**Thoughts**: I'm really enjoying working with the HTTP request syntax (PUT, POST, etc.).

### Day 51: February 22nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked with API calls by building a simple GitHub user requester app in JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: I will definitely be able to use this information/project layout in future projects.

### Day 52: February 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I coded along with a JavaScript weather app tutorial. The API that the tutorial used is deprecated, so I had to port it over to the free and open-source Weatherstack API. I'm not yet finished with figuring out how to make the app function with a different API.

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying the challenge of straying from the tutorial parameters to try to implement a different API.

### Day 53: February 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: The app was modified in order to make it work with the Weatherstack API. I also fixed a bug where the app wasn't loading a default location whenever the page was loaded for the first time.

**Thoughts**: Squashing bugs === fun

### Day 54: February 25th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I studied Bootstrap and jQuery for about an hour on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Both concepts came very easily after studying pure CSS and JavaScript for a couple months.

### Day 55: February 26th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I studied Sass on freeCodeCamp. I also completed a small JavaScript project that involved practicing regular expressions by creating a form validator app.

**Thoughts**: Sass is pretty crazy. It basically turns CSS into an actual programming language, akin to JavaScript.
