### I chose to fork this repo in order to add another layer of accountability to my pursuit of completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

### Day 13: January 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked all the way through the Applied Visual Design module (Responsive Web Design) on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: I love working with HTML and CSS. I look forward to applying these lessons to my own personal webpage creations. I'm also looking forward to the responsive web design projects. Maybe I'll love it less when I get deep into creating my own pages. Lol.
