## Log

### I chose to fork this repo to add another layer of accountability to my pursuit of completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

### Day 1: April 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on configuring the CSS and React state of my portfolio website.

**Thoughts**: It's looking much cleaner now.

### Day 2: April 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Refactored CSS to implement LESS, the CSS precompiler. Also implemented React Router.

**Thoughts**: I'm learning so much at this time in my life. I've grown so much since just the start of thsi year. It's crazy.

### Day 3: April 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished tweaking the routing logic. Completely refactored the code with map(), useEffect, and other functions to completely avoid repetition.

**Thoughts**: That was painful, but so worth it.
